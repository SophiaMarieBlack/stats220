> **The meme above is a wonderful example of what can be done with Markdown!** A simple few brackets and an exclamation mark, and we've got a meme!

### Some things that will be demonstrated here are:
1. `Markdown`!
2. `R`!
3. Making Memes!

##### For example, the following below has been created using the markdown that I have currently learnt: 


Reasons to ***love*** GitHub!:
* It's simple

### My University of Auckland Study History

For example, I'll show you the courses I've currently taken or am *taking*, demonstrating the useage of a table! 

| Course  | Semester |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| COMPSCI 110  | 2023 Sem 1  |
| COMPSCI 101  | 2023 Sem 1  |
| MATHS 102  | 2023 Sem 1 |
| CHINESE 100G  | 2023 Sem 1  |
| COMPSCI 130  | 2023 Sem 2  |
| INFOSYS 110  | 2023 Sem 2  |
| INFOMGMT 192  | 2023 Sem 2  |
| PHYSICS 140 | 2023 Sem 2  |
| BUSAN 201 | 2024 Sem 1  |
| STATS 220 | 2024 Sem 1  |
| STATS 101 | 2024 Sem 1  |
| COMPSCI 215 | 2024 Sem 1  |

The same can be said with checkboxes! If we combine '-' and '[]' we can have checkboxes appear on our screen. For example,

**My completed courses:**

- [x] Semester 1 2023
- [x] Semester 2 2023
- [ ] Semester 1 2024

gives the visual apperance of ticked or unticked boxes.

We can also demonstrate the useage of including links with '[]' and '()', which links words or text phrases to external websites! And by adding a simple '!' to the beginning, it can change to an image instead!
